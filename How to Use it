Important Note : 

Ideally it's recommended to clone the source code from GITLAB only. This way we can maintain the version controls and central control of the script. 
So, please fix the access issues of GITLAB. Below is just a kind of another option to launch the script from shared path use it in case of emergency only.


python3 /home/pupad/Cisco_IOSXE_NNIv2_ConfigSyncer.py
